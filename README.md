# Portfolio-project-Python-Notes-App
Basic terminal program in Python3 as part of Codeacademy Computer Science Career Path, CS101, introduction to programming
https://github.com/Facumerino/Portfolio-project-Python-Notes-App.git

After acquiring all the knowledge about how to code in python, the last effort to complete this chapter was to create a terminal game or program running on python, were Codeacademy gave us some ideas to work with, but I stick with the one that said “Create your own idea”, giving me freedom to decide or choose whatever I wanted to create, putting in work all my imagination to create something unique and different than those options displayed as examples.

FIRST STEPS
Everything started with a brainstorming, or like I did, a scheme of how the program will work and what do I have to include to make it work property, starting off by putting everything my imagination said in that moment. After that, I analyzed in deep which ideas are more suitable for my project and my level of coding, coming to the conclusion that my program would be a kind of notebook where the user could write their notes, adding the possibility of scheduling reminders and tasks

THE PROCESS
The idea was settled, so now, it comes the difficult part, start coding!
I started with the basics, defining the variables (Notebook, Notes, Reminders and Tasks) and their corresponding functions (which in my case I made a lot of use of Object-Oriented Programming). After that, I created the relations between each variable and made a kind of interactive menu so that the user can use each of the functions in an easy and intuitive way

TESTING AND DEBUGGING
When everything was finished, testing is the most complicated part, since many bugs can appear in the process, however I managed to do a deep test, identifying each flaw in my code to solve it and that the user has the best possible experience using my program

CONCLUSION
This project definitely put into play all my learned python programming skills, being demonstrated in each line of code written in my own program, giving us a real experience of how a programmer creates a program from scratch, dealing with errors, bugs and constant changes so that at the end of the process, the result is as expected
